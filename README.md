This project is an implementation of a simple hash table and Binary Search Tree in the Java programming language. 
A hash table is one of the most commonly used data structures and is used for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. For each node, the left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
